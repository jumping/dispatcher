# dispatcher

Router dispatcher for Go web applications.

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/chuckpreslar/dispatcher/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/chuckpreslar/dispatcher/latest)

## Installation

With Google's [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine:

    $ go get -u github.com/golib/dispatcher

## Usage

### Introduction

To get started using dispatcher, simply:

```go
package main

import(
    "net/http"
)

import(
    "github.com/golib/dispatcher"
)

func SomePathHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Handle the request.
}

func main() {
    // Initialize a new Router instance.
    router := dispatcher.NewRouter()
    
    // Register a HandlerFunc.
    router.Match("/some/path", SomePathHandler)
    
    // Start your server.
    http.ListenAndServe(":3000" /* Port to listen on */, router)
}
```

The Router's Match method will match a request based only on the HTTP Request's URL Path, ignoring the method.

### Routing based on HTTP Method

Dispatcher supports route dispatching for most* supported HTTP methods.  To have a handler respond to a specific HTTP method, simply call the corresponding receiver method on the Router you've created passing it the path to match and the handler to use when a request with a matching path is encountered.
```go
//...

func main() {
    router := dispatcher.NewRouter()
    
    router.
        Get("/get/something", GetSomethingHandler).
        Put("/put/something", PutSomethingHandler).
        Post("/post/something", PostSomethingHandler).
        Delete("/delete/something", DeleteSomethingHandler)
        
    http.ListenAndServe(":3000" /* Port to listen on */, router)
}
```

### Path Matching

__Match Explicit Path__

```go
    // Matches route `/posts`
    router.Match("/posts", PostsHandler)
```

__Match Path with Required Parameters__

```go
    // Matches route `/posts/2012`, `/posts/2013`, etc.
    router.Match("/posts/:year", IndividualPostsHandler)
```

__Match Path with Optional Parameters__

```go
    // Matches route `/posts/2013` and `/posts/2013/january`
    router.Match("/posts/:id/:option?", IndividualPostsHandler)
```

__Match Wildcard__

```go    
    // Matches any route starting with `/posts` (i.e. `/posts/`, `/posts/2013`, `/posts/2013/january`)
    router.Match("/posts/*", WildcardPostsHandler)
```

### Accessing Path Parameters
    
### Middleware

Route middleware is registered as follows:

```go
    //...
    router.RegisterMiddleware(func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) bool {
        // Middleware handler.
        return true || false
    })
```

Dispatcher attempts to call each piece of registered middleware with every request.  If the middleware handler returns true, Dispatcher assumes that the request was handled by the middleware and it no longer needs to attempt to find a registered Route and handler for the request.  If the middleware returns false, the next registered middleware handler runs or an attempt to find a registered Route and handler is made.

__TODO:__
* Finalize route parameter retrieval.
* Finalize public asset serving middleware.
* Finalize session support middleware.
